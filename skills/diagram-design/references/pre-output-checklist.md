# Pre-Output Checklist (Taste Gate)

This is the executable review procedure extracted from `SKILL.md` §9. Run it before delivering any diagram.

## 9. Pre-Output Checklist (Taste Gate)

Run before producing any diagram.

**Type fit:**

- [ ] If behavior matters, did I choose one semantic pattern before the visual type and load `semantic-patterns.md`?
- [ ] Right visual type for the layout? (§3 visual-type guide)
- [ ] Stated type, pattern, size preset, and planned cuts before drawing — confirmed, or assumptions noted? (§3)
- [ ] Would a table / paragraph do the same job? (If yes — don't draw.)
- [ ] Loaded the matching type reference linked in the visual-type guide?
- [ ] If this is an import — format, size, detail level, and audience set? `viewBox` and type ramp match the size preset? (§11, [output-spec.md §6](references/output-spec.md))
- [ ] If this is an import — fidelity ledger ready to report? (§11)

**Remove test:**

- [ ] Can I remove any node? (Would a reader still understand?)
- [ ] Can I merge any two nodes? (Do they always travel together?)
- [ ] Can I remove any arrow? (Is the relationship obvious from layout?)
- [ ] Can I remove any label? (Does color or shape already signal it?)

**Signal:**

- [ ] Brand accent used on ≤2 elements? If more, which actually deserve focal status?
- [ ] Legend covers every type used — and nothing extra?
- [ ] Within the type's complexity budget (§7)?

**Technical:**

- [ ] Diagram `<svg>` has `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` resolving to its `<title>` and `<desc>`?
- [ ] `<title>` is the first child of `<svg>` (before `<defs>`) and both `<title>` and `<desc>` are filled in?
- [ ] `<title>` / `<desc>` IDs are prefixed for this diagram and variant — never bare `title` / `desc`?
- [ ] Arrows drawn before boxes?
- [ ] **Every connector between off-axis nodes uses a rounded right-angle elbow (`r=8`)? No diagonal `<line>` slants?**
- [ ] **Every arrow label has a visible 6–10px gap above its connector? (Mask rect not touching the stroke.)**
- [ ] **No two connectors overlap, share a stroke path, or run on top of each other? Crossings use the bridge/hop primitive?**
- [ ] **When several connectors enter or exit the same edge of a box, each has its own attach point (≥12px apart)? No connector hides another?**
- [ ] **No connector passes behind a non-endpoint box, except the unavoidable-intervening-box case (§6 rule 5) — and in that case, the stroke is dashed and the label sits at the visible end?**
- [ ] **No label mask overlaps a node drawn after it? (Node fill would clip the text — §6 rule 6. The browser review owns this check.)**
- [ ] Every arrow label has an opaque `fill="#F7F9F9"` rect behind it?
- [ ] Legend is a horizontal bottom strip, not floating?
- [ ] No vertical `writing-mode` text?
- [ ] `viewBox` expanded for the legend strip (~60px)?
- [ ] Node origins, dimensions, gaps, padding on the 4px grid; type sizes on the role ramp?
- [ ] From the installed skill directory, did `python3 scripts/artifact_gate.py validate <candidate.html> --json` pass? (Accessible SVG, single-file safety, motion basics, and executable geometry baseline.)
- [ ] Did the diagram render at its final size in a real browser? Capture or inspect it at 100% zoom; reject clipped text, overflow outside the `viewBox`, unreadable labels, hidden arrowheads, and connector collisions. Use the available browser tool or Playwright rather than judging HTML source alone.
- [ ] If both light and dark variants are delivered, render both. A valid light diagram does not prove the dark palette or translucent hairlines remain legible.
- [ ] If animated, does the complete static/no-JS frame work, does reduced motion hide/disable playback, and is the controller copied verbatim from `assets/template-motion.html`? Run `python3 scripts/self_check.py <file>` and manually check print and static-query states in the browser.

**Typography:**

- [ ] Brand match uses exact public families/weights, verified via `getComputedStyle`; fallbacks disclosed?
- [ ] Human-readable names in Geist sans, not Geist Mono?
- [ ] Technical sublabels (ports, commands, URLs) in Geist Mono?
- [ ] Page title in Instrument Serif?
- [ ] Annotation callouts (if any) in *italic* Instrument Serif? (see [primitive-annotation.md](references/primitive-annotation.md))
- [ ] No JetBrains Mono anywhere?
